\section{Conclusions}

%Major headings, for example, "1. Introduction", should appear in all capital letters, bold face, centered in the column, with one blank line before, and one blank line after. Use a period (".") after the heading number, not a colon.

%If the last page of your paper is only partially filled, arrange the columns so that they are evenly balanced if possible, rather than having one long column.

%List and number all bibliographical references at the end of the paper.  The references can be numbered in order of appearance in the document.  When referring to them in the text, type the corresponding reference number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence \cite{Smith_year}.

%To insert citations in \LaTeX, use {\small \verb|\cite{<author>}|}, which produces ``\cite{Jones_year} ''. The bibliography is located in file {\small \verb|07_SBSR.bib|}. The references are automatically generated.
