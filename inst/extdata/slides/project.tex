    \frametitle{Research questions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item NEW QUESTIONS:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item How much DETER's area doesn't have a heat spot?
            \item What is FireCCI's confidence required to make it match DETER?
            \item How many DETER's Burned Area polygons fall inside PRODES?
            \item How many sucessive burns are needed for deforestation?
            \item How many DETER's areas don't have a heat spot?
            \item Are the burned areas counted more than once if they last long
                enoug?
        \end{itemize}
        \item DETER:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Is DETER understimating burn area?
            \item How many yearly events happened before first mapping? How 
                many fires are needed for deforestation? Are burn scars 
                actually re-burns?
            \item How does DETER compare to INPE's Quemaidas?
            \item How is deforestation by sucessive degradation shown in DETER?
            \item Can a burned area be on fire more than once?
            \item How do fire events relate to PRODES and TERRACLASS?
        \end{itemize}
        \item OTHER:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item How do we avoid counting each fire more than once? 
            \item How do we prepare fire data to feed a GHG emission model?
            \item How do fire maps compare? NOTE: Validate fire products. 
            \item Can we merge this data products to improve GHG emission 
                estimations?
            \item Is a burn scar actually a reburn?
            \item Is fire re-occurrence really 60\%?
            \item Is it possible to link fires to burn scars?
            \item Can the heat focus be used to build a re-burn index?
            \item Is the fire product overestimating frequency?
            \item First fire is weak, probably they aren't mapped. What was the 
                time before the first detection? How many times did they burn 
                before first detection? Check Norton' paper 2011.
            \item How are the fire events characterized (shape, area, 
                detection interval)?
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{PRODES}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unlike DETER, PRODES data doesn't explicity label deforestation
            polygons as fire-scars.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{DETER project}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Near Real Time alert system with low false-positive rate 
            (Amazon) coupled to IBAMA and law enforcement on the field. 
        \item Started in 2004 (PPCDAm).

    \frametitle{DETER - Meeting with Marcos Adami}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Why are fire scars collected by DETER? What for?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Back in 2004 DETER used MODIS data. Then in 2008, polygons' 
                size fell, so they started using ISRO's ResourceSat. They 
                started using Spectral Mixture Model looking for selective 
                logging and fire becuase they thuought it was interesting for
                IBAMA.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Could fire scars be duplicated? 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Yes, but in different years, not in the same year.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Are the fire scars curated differently from other deforestation 
            polygons?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item No, all DETER's polygons are drawn using visual 
                interpretation on imagery and a Linear Mixture Model.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Are they underestimated? i.e. Fire was not detected by later 
            deforestation was.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item NA
        \end{itemize}
        \item What are the differences between DETER, DETER-B, and DETER 
            intenso?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item They are the same. However, DETER intenso uses a ROI and 
                higher spatial resolution data but it's not public.
        \end{itemize}
        \item What are DETER's recommended papers?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item DETER-R: An Operational Near-Real Time Tropical Forest 
                Disturbance Warning System Based on Sentinel-1 Time Series 
                Analysis.

    Object-Based Classification Method on a Systematic Sample of Medium 
    Resolution Satellite Images~\cite{shimabukuro2015}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This paper proposes a systematic sample in a degree grid (20 x20 
            Km) to assess burned area assessment.
        \item Estimate 2010's burned areas in Mato Grosso using JRC's 
            pan-tropical deforestation survey and cloud-free Landsat 5 imagery.
        \item Compare results to INPE's method (method 2) and to MCD64A1 
            (method 3).
        \item Method 1: Imagery preprocessing includes radiometric calibration, 
            dehazing, spectral normalization, cloud masking, miltistage 
            segmentation of at least 5Ha.
        \item Method 2: Generate mixture model, segmentation of shade fraction,
            unsupervised classification, visual labeling (burned \& non-burned)
            edition of classification.
        \item Method 3: Use only MCD64A1 from before Landsat images' date. 
            Also, use MCD64A1 to estimate the proportion of total burned area.

    \frametitle{A new global burned area product for climate assessment of fire 
    impacts: A new global burned area product~\cite{chuvieco2016}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This paper introduces Fire CCI.
        \item It uses the MERIS BA algorithm.
        \item Pixel (GeoTIFF) is a monthly, 300mts resolution, product 
            splitted by continent. It includes detection date, confidence, and 
            land cover (derived from Globcover2005).
        \item Burned Area (NetCDF-CF) is a 15-day, 0.5 degree resolution 
            product. It includes the total burned area, standard error, area 
            fraction, number of patches, and land cover.
        \item Cross-analysis with other BA products (2006-2008) used 
            spatio-temporal flooding algorithm and metrics perimeter to ratio, 
            ellipse elongation, azimuthal angle, deviation from the North. The
            overall accuracy was 99.6\%.
        \item Fire CCI and Global Fire Emission Database BA produce comparable 
            results in simulations of fire emissions.
        \item Fire CCI Burned Area estimations have higher errors than MODIS BA
            products, but they are better balanced with less understimation 
            (close to 35\%).

    \frametitle{Tracking and classifying Amazon fire events in near real time
    ~\cite{andela2022}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are 4 kind of fires: Deforestation, leak fires, 
            agricultural management, and natural.
        \item Cluster fire detections into individual fires using Global Fire
            Atlas, VIRRS, Sentinel2, MODIS, GFED4.
        \item Multiday metrics and expert-guided classification.
        \item Method:
            \begin{itemize}
            \item This study combines active fire detections from VIIRS to map 
                the extent of individual fires using the Global Fire Atlas 
                    algorithm.
            \item It combines adjacent and sequential daily detections to 
                estimate fire behavior.
            \item Fires were classified into 4: Deforestation, Forest, Small 
                Clearing, and Savanna.
            \item It uses the fire season data of 2019.
            \item Fire data were combined to LULC to help fire classification.
            \item Fire classification was expert-guided because there was no 
                training data available.
            \item Classification validation using (Monitoring of the Andean 
                Amazom project (MAAP) and Sentinel2 images.

        \item Cloud cover is the main challenge to Near Real Time deforestation
            monitoring systems. However, radas isn't as sensible to clouds as
            optical imagery.
        \item DETER-R uses Sentinel1 Radar images hosted and processed in 
            Google Earth Engine.
        \item DETER-R is a forest disturbance detection method based on 
            time-series thresholding. The false-alert ration can be fixed by
            setting the number of standard deviations~\cite{doblas2020}.
        \item This method make no assumptions about the non-forest 
            backscattering distribution.
        \item DETER-R is an automated NRT forest disturbance detection 
            system based on Sentinel1 data hosted in Google Earth Engine. After
            automated analysis, forest disturbance pixel clusters are 
            vectorized and sent to environmental enforcement agencies.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item 9PB of public data (imagery, geophysical, weather forecast, 
            climate models) (2017).
        \item API: Javascript and Python.
        \item Data Models: Feature,  Images, Collections.
        \item Feature: line, point, polygon, list of properties.
        \item Images: Stack of bands (mask, projection, resolution), a list of 
            properties (date, bbox).
            \item Collection: Bag of elements (table of features, directory of
            images).
        \item Map: Apply a function fo each element of a collection (for each).
        \item Reduce: Apply a fucntion to everything in a collection 
            (aggregation). We can reduce neighborhood, regions, feature 
            collections, to vectors.
        \item Band math.
        \item Computation: On the fly process, tile by tile. Scatter and 
            gatter.
