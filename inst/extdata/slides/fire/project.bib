  abstract = {Fire is a significant agent of landscape transformation on Earth, and a dynamic and ephemeral process that is challenging to map. Difficulties include the seasonality of native vegetation in areas affected by fire, the high levels of spectral heterogeneity due to the spatial and temporal variability of the burned areas, distinct persistence of the fire signal, increase in cloud and smoke cover surrounding burned areas, and difficulty in detecting understory fire signals. To produce a large-scale time-series of burned area, a robust number of observations and a more efficient sampling strategy is needed. In order to overcome these challenges, we used a novel strategy based on a machine-learning algorithm to map monthly burned areas from 1985 to 2020 using Landsat-based annual quality mosaics retrieved from minimum NBR values. The annual mosaics integrated year-round observations of burned and unburned spectral data (i.e., RED, NIR, SWIR-1, and SWIR-2), and used them to train a Deep Neural Network model, which resulted in annual maps of areas burned by land use type for all six Brazilian biomes. The annual dataset was used to retrieve the frequency of the burned area, while the date on which the minimum NBR was captured in a year, was used to reconstruct 36 years of monthly burned area. Results of this effort indicated that 19.6\% (1.6 million km2) of the Brazilian territory was burned from 1985 to 2020, with 61\% of this area burned at least once. Most of the burning (83\%) occurred between July and October. The Amazon and Cerrado, together, accounted for 85\% of the area burned at least once in Brazil. Native vegetation was the land cover most affected by fire, representing 65\% of the burned area, while the remaining 35\% burned in areas dominated by anthropogenic land uses, mainly pasture. This novel dataset is crucial for understanding the spatial and long-term temporal dynamics of fire regimes that are fundamental for designing appropriate public policies for reducing and controlling fires in Brazil.},

However, the inability to rapidly separate satellite fire detections by fire type hampered fire suppression and assessment of ecosystem and air quality impacts. Here, we describe the development of a near\textendash real-time approach for tracking contributions from deforestation, forest, agricultural, and savanna fires to burned area and emissions and apply the approach to the 2019 fire season in South America. Across the southern Amazon, 19,700 deforestation fire events accounted for 39\% of all satellite active fire detections and the majority of fire carbon emissions (63\%; 69 Tg C). Multiday fires accounted for 81\% of burned area and 92\% of carbon emissions from the Amazon, with many forest fires burning uncontrolled for weeks. Most fire detections from deforestation fires were correctly identified within 2 days (67\%), highlighting the potential to improve situational awareness and management outcomes during fire emergencies.           ,              Near\textendash real-time tracking of individual fires can distinguish fire types to support rapid responses to Amazon fire emergencies.},

Most of the operational EWS are based on optical data, which are severely limited by the cloud cover in tropical environments. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data can help to overcome this observational gap. SAR measurements, however, can be altered by atmospheric effects on and variations in surface moisture. Different techniques of time series (TS) stabilization have been used to mitigate the instability of C-band SAR measurements. Here, we evaluate the performance of two different approaches to SAR TS stabilization, harmonic deseasonalization and spatial stabilization, as well as two deforestation detection techniques, Adaptive Linear Thresholding (ALT) and maximum likelihood classification (MLC). We set up a rigorous, Amazon-wide validation experiment using the Google Earth Engine platform to sample and process Sentinel-1A data of nearly 6000 locations in the whole Brazilian Amazonian basin, generating more than 8M processed samples. Half of those locations correspond to non-degraded forest areas, while the other half pertained to 2019 deforested areas. The detection results showed that the spatial stabilization algorithm improved the results of the MLC approach, reaching 94.36\% global accuracy. The ALT detection algorithm performed better, reaching 95.91\% global accuracy, regardless of the use of any stabilization method. The results of this experiment are being used to develop an operational EWS in the Brazilian Amazon.},

  abstract = {Continuous monitoring of forest disturbance on tropical forests is a fundamental tool to support proactive preservation actions and to stop further destruction of native vegetation. Currently most of the monitoring systems in operation are based on optical imagery, and thus are flaw-prone on areas with frequent cloud cover. As this, several Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based systems have been developed recently, aiming all-weather disturbance detection. This article presents the main aspects and the results of the first year of operation of the SAR based Near Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (DETER-R), an automated deforestation detection system focused on the Brazilian Amazon. DETER-R uses the Google Earth Engine platform to preprocess and analyze Sentinel-1 SAR time series. New images are treated and analyzed daily. After the automated analysis, the system vectorizes clusters of deforested pixels and sends the corresponding polygons to the environmental enforcement agency. After 12 months of operational life, the system has produced 88,572 forest disturbance warnings. Human validation of the warning polygons showed a extremely low rate of misdetections, with less than 0.2\% of the detected area corresponding to false positives. During the first year of operation, DETER-R provided 33,234 warnings of interest to national monitoring agencies which were not detected by its optical counterpart DETER in the same period, corresponding to an area of 105,238.5 ha, or approximately 5\% of the total detections. During the rainy season, the rate of additional detections increased as expected, reaching 8.1\%.},

  abstract = {In the Amazon, fires are normally associated with the management of agricultural areas and conversion of forests into productive lands. The occurrence of fires in Amazonia causes direct impacts on the vegetation, affecting directly carbon emissions, with the disruption of the natural carbon cycle, consequently contributing to global climate change. Several studies aim to understand fire dynamics and correlated processes using remote sensing. The availability of orbital data, generating global fire products and a range of digital image processing techniques allow the comprehensive understanding of fire processes. This study, hence, aims to test the viability of MODIS and VIIRS data for quantifying burned scars in the Brazilian Legal Amazonia, analysing their potential against global mapping products. We found that MODIS data were the most accurate for identifying burned areas, considering processing time and the possibility of implementing this methodology operationally for the monitoring of burned areas in Amazonia.},

Understanding how social and ecological systems respond to fire is an important topic for the coming century. But many countries do not have accessible fire history data. There are several satellite-based products available as gridded data, but these can be difficult to access and use, and require significant computational resources and time to convert into a usable product for a specific area of interest. We developed an open source software package called Fire Event Delineation for python (FIREDpy) which automatically downloads and processes all of the source files for an area of interest from the MODIS burned area product, and runs a spatiotemporal flooding algorithm that converts those hundreds of grids into a single fire perimeter shapefile. Here we present a collection of fire event perimeter datasets for every country on the globe that we created using the FIREDpy software. We will continue to improve the efficiency and flexibility of the underlying algorithm, and intend to update these datasets annually.},

  abstract = {Understory fires in Amazon forests alter forest structure, species composition, and the likelihood of future disturbance. The annual extent of fire-damaged forest in Amazonia remains uncertain due to difficulties in separating burning from other types of forest damage in satellite data. We developed a new approach, the Burn Damage and Recovery (BDR) algorithm, to identify fire-related canopy damages using spatial and spectral information from multi-year time series of satellite data. The BDR approach identifies understory fires in intact and logged Amazon forests based on the reduction and recovery of live canopy cover in the years following fire damages and the size and shape of individual understory burn scars. The BDR algorithm was applied to time series of Landsat (1997\textendash 2004) and MODIS (2000\textendash 2005) data covering one Landsat scene (path/row 226/068) in southern Amazonia and the results were compared to field observations, imagederived burn scars, and independent data on selective logging and deforestation. Landsat resolution was essential for detection of burn scars b 50 ha, yet these small burns contributed only 12\% of all burned forest detected during 1997\textendash 2002. MODIS data were suitable for mapping medium (50\textendash 500 ha) and large (N 500 ha) burn scars that accounted for the majority of all fire-damaged forests in this study. Therefore, moderate resolution satellite data may be suitable to provide estimates of the extent of fire-damaged Amazon forest at a regional scale. In the study region, Landsat-based understory fire damages in 1999 (1508 km2) were an order of magnitude higher than during the 1997\textendash 1998 El Ni\~no event (124 km2 and 39 km2, respectively), suggesting a different link between climate and understory fires than previously reported for other Amazon regions. The results in this study illustrate the potential to address critical questions concerning climate and fire risk in Amazon forests by applying the BDR algorithm over larger areas and longer image time series.},

  abstract = {Recent drought events underscore the vulnerability of Amazon forests to understorey fires. The long-term impact of fires on biodiversity and forest carbon stocks depends on the frequency of fire damages and deforestation rates of burned forests. Here, we characterized the spatial and temporal dynamics of understorey fires (1999\textendash 2010) and deforestation (2001\textendash 2010) in southern Amazonia using new satellite-based estimates of annual fire activity (greater than 50 ha) and deforestation (greater than 10 ha). Understorey forest fires burned more than 85 500 km               2               between 1999 and 2010 (2.8\% of all forests). Forests that burned more than once accounted for 16 per cent of all understorey fires. Repeated fire activity was concentrated in Mato Grosso and eastern Par\'a, whereas single fires were widespread across the arc of deforestation. Routine fire activity in Mato Grosso coincided with annual periods of low night-time relative humidity, suggesting a strong climate control on both single and repeated fires. Understorey fires occurred in regions with active deforestation, yet the interannual variability of fire and deforestation were uncorrelated, and only 2.6 per cent of forests that burned between 1999 and 2008 were deforested for agricultural use by 2010. Evidence from the past decade suggests that future projections of frontier landscapes in Amazonia should separately consider economic drivers to project future deforestation and climate to project fire risk.},

  abstract = {Carbon (C) emissions from forest fires in the Amazon during extreme droughts may correspond to more than half of the global emissions resulting from land cover changes. Despite their relevant contribution, forest fire-related C emissions are not directly accounted for within national-level inventories or carbon budgets. A fundamental condition for quantifying these emissions is to have a reliable estimation of the extent and location of land cover types affected by fires. Here, we evaluated the relative performance of four burned area products (TREES, MCD64A1 c6, GABAM, and Fire\_cci v5.0), contrasting their estimates of total burned area, and their influence on the fire-related C emissions in the Amazon biome for the year 2015. In addition, we distinguished the burned areas occurring in forests from non-forest areas. The four products presented great divergence in the total burned area and, consequently, total related C emissions. Globally, the TREES product detected the largest amount of burned area (35,559 km2), and consequently it presented the largest estimate of committed carbon emission (45 Tg), followed by MCD64A1, with only 3\% less burned area detected, GABAM (28,193 km2) and Fire\_cci (14,924 km2). The use of Fire\_cci may result in an underestimation of 29.54 {$\pm$} 3.36 Tg of C emissions in relation to the TREES product. The same pattern was found for non-forest areas. Considering only forest burned areas, GABAM was the product that detected the largest area (8994 km2), followed by TREES (7985 km2), MCD64A1 (7181 km2) and Fire\_cci (1745 km2). Regionally, Fire\_cci detected 98\% less burned area in Acre state in southwest Amazonia than TREES, and approximately 160 times less burned area in forests than GABAM. Thus, we show that global products used interchangeably on a regional scale could significantly underestimate the impacts caused by fire and, consequently, their related carbon emissions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for estimating burned areas at a regional scale, using a systematic sample of medium spatial resolution satellite images. This approach is based on a pan-tropical deforestation survey developed by the Joint Research Centre. We developed and tested our approach over Mato Grosso State, located in the Brazilian Legal Amazon region, with a total area of 903 366 km2. We analyze Landsat-5 TM imagery over 77 sample sites (20 km \texttimes{} 20 km in size) located at each full degree confluence of latitude and longitude. Our new approach leads to an estimate of burned area for year 2010 at 66 368 km2, representing approximately 7.3\% of the Mato Grosso area. This estimate is compared to estimates from two different approaches: 1) from a method developed by the Brazilian Institute for Space Research, applied to a wall-to-wall coverage of Landsat-5 TM imagery and 2) from a method using MODIS MCD64A1 products of the University of Maryland, resulting in 70 232 and 55 157 km2 of burned area, respectively (representing 7.8\% or 6.1\% of Mato Grosso area). Our method produces statistically valid estimates of burned areas for the Brazilian State of Mato Grosso in a more efficient manner than previous methods and enables the inclusion of small burn scars typically missed by coarse resolution satellites. This approach can be applied for regional and global assessments as well as for refining and evaluating burned area products based on coarse spatial resolution imagery like MODIS or SPOT-VEGETATION.},
